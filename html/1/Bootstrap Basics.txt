1. Bootstrap 3 is designed to be responsive to mobile devices. Mobile-first styles are part of the core framework.

To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, add the following <meta> tag inside the <head> element:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The initial-scale=1 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.


2. Containers

Bootstrap also requires a containing element to wrap site contents.

There are two container classes to choose from:

The .container class provides a responsive fixed width container
The .container-fluid class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport
Note: Containers are not nestable (you cannot put a container inside another container).



3. Grid Classes(12 columns)
The Bootstrap grid system has four classes:

xs (for phones)
sm (for tablets)
md (for desktops)
lg (for larger desktops)
The classes above can be combined to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.
